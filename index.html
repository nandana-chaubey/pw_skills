  <!-- Question 1 : Explain the basic structure of an HTML page. Why is it important to follow
this structure? -->

<!-- Answer -->
 Document Type Declaration (<!DOCTYPE html>): This tells the browser the document is an HTML5 document. 
<html> (HTML Root): This element encloses all other elements in the HTML document. 
<head>: This section contains metadata that isn't displayed directly on the webpage. It includes: 
<title>: Defines the title that appears in the browser tab. 
<meta>: Provides information like character set, viewport settings, or descriptions for search engines. 
<body>: This section contains the main content of the webpage that users will see. 

  A well-structured HTML document is easier to read, understand, and modify, making it easier for developers to maintain and update websites. It provides semantic meaning for screen readers. Proper HTML structure, including metadata in the <head>, helps search engines understand the content and improve search results.

<!-- Question 6: Ravi wants to leave a note in his HTML file so that only other developers
can see it, not the users on the website. How should he do this? Why are such notes
useful? -->

<!-- Answer -->

Ravi should use HTML comments to leave notes in his HTML file that are visible to developers but not users. HTML comments are enclosed within <!-- and --> tags and are ignored by the browser. This is a convenient way to add internal documentation or notes without affecting the rendered webpage. 
Because
HTML comments can explain the purpose of code blocks, how they work, or any assumptions made during development.
